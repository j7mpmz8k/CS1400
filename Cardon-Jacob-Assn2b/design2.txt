set up functions for calculating dynamic aspect ratio, drawing circles efficiently, and calculating overlap of circles

Prompt the user for:
    Superhero name
    Body size - This is the diameter of their body.
    Location - X, Y location. Use two prompts to get this
    Arm length
    Leg length(re-prompt user if not greater than arm length)
    Sword length(re-prompt user if sword+arm length not greater than leg length)(equal to body radius + arm and sword length)
    Voice power (re-prompt user if not greater than arm+sword length)(equal to body radius size + voice power input)
calculate(find total diameters to draw by multiplying radii by 2):
    Kick diameter(body radius + leg length)*2
    Punch diameter(body radius + arm length)*2
    Sword diameter(body radius + arm length + sword length)*2
    Voice power diameter(voice length)*2
Welcome message for Superhero

Prompt user for:
    Villain name
    Body size
    Location(no overlap with hero...compare sum of radii of villain and hero...no overlap if distance between center points is greater or equal
Mean message for the the Villain

Ask user for input: Hit Enter to help {Superhero_name} fight {villain_name}.

Draw the scene with Drawly (Give the window a title of {superhero_name} vs. {villain_name})
    store possible attack actions (ie. name, color, diameter) in dictionary
    loop through possible attacks and draw each action with stored color and diameter(line thickness of 3 pixels for each circle)
    draw the Superhero and Villain with appropriate location and size


Print a message telling the Superhero what to do
    store best attack in dictionary("name":diameter)...best attack--> closest range to villain while at least touching
    print best attack after looping through comparing each possible attack with the currect best attack
    Notify user if if Villain is out of range for hero to attack
