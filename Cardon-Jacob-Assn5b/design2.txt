Cursor class
    attributes
        screen
        image
        rect of image
        sound effect
        collision center position
        collision radius
        cursor offset (based on collision center to draw cursor image)
    init
        parameters
            game mode - catching or killing
            sound effect
            image path
            pygame screen
            image scale - default 5%
        load image
            scale image (maintain aspect ratio of original image)
            algorith: new width = original width * scale, new height = original height * (new width / original width)
        check if game mode is "killing" or "catching"
            caclulate collision radius and offset based on game mode since meaningful collisions from images are different
        initialize collision center to top left corner of screen
    update_pos()
        set collision center to mouse position
        set cursor rect top left corner to collision center minus x,y offsets
            clamp top left corner of cursor rect to inside of screen
        recalcuate collision center based on clamped rect
            collision center is top left corner of cursor rect plus x,y offsets
    draw()
        draw cursor image on screen

        draw critter image on screen

    move_critter()
        update rect to rect.move(move_x, move_y)
        call check_bounce()

    check_bounce()
         inverts x or y move by -1 if rect hits edge of screen
         clamp position within screen

    did_get()
        parameters
            cursor object
        check if critter's radius collides with cursor's collision radius
            if yes, return critter type

    parameters
        critter count
        screen
        list of images
    loop through number half of critter count (repeat twice for each type "good" and "bad")
        create critter object
            pass parameters into Critter() along with type
            store critter in critter list
        call move_critter() on each critter in list
