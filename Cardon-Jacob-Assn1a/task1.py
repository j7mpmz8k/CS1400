I am interested in software engineering. I was initially hesitant to enter the career with the long line of unemployment
that exists in the market today. 

Year after year it seems there is another huge wave of layoffs. I found a video 
titled "Why Software Engineering is No Longer a Dream Job" by Sajjaad Khader. While it might sound doom and gloom from
the video title, I took from it a much more hopefull message. He shows that since the age of computers, there have been
many many waves of layoffs and many many waves of hiring booms. Historically the stagnations in the market only last
around 3-6 years or somewhere around there. As markets and technology change, new demand arises. However this often
requires new sets of skills to adapt to these demands. This video serves as insider insight to a path I need to follow.
If I can stay at least a few steps ahead and do no stagnate myself, I am optomistic myself that computer science and
software engineering has a bright future ahead of me. 

It seems some of the new competition arising is the uprising of
artificial intelligence. While I am hopefull that it will not fully replace my job, my assumption is that if it does
most careers would most likely suffer similar reprocussions. My strategy is to gain skills in ai, both in engineering ai
tools and utilizing those tools to accelerate my work. 

Lastly I am aware memory safe languages seem to be the future, I
intend languages such as Rust to hopefully have a competitive edge after I graduate.
